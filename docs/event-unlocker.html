  <h2>Event Rewards Unlocker</h2>
  <p>Rewards for <b>Happy at Home Login Event</b> were stored locally on your computer. Because of that some people lost them, and so EA decided to add them all to the base game in update version <code>1.109.207</code>. So you no longer need this tool. Rewards for <b>Reaper's Rewards Event</b> are stored on a server. That means unlocking them would work in offline mode only. Every time you start the game online it overwrites a file with reward unlocks. Given all that you should use mods instead - they work both online and offline.</p>

  <span>To quickly find the event rewards in game you can use the "Special" &gt; "Event Rewards" filter.</span>
